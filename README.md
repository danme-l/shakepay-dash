Data Visualizer for Shakepay, a Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange.

Users can download all of their data in csv format from their account page. That csv file can be uploaded here (when it's live) to view some cool info and metrics about their usage.

I am not at all affiliated with Shakepay, just a guy who likes their service.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
